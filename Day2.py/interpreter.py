'''    
implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

x is an integer
y is +, -, *, or /
z is an integer
For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.
        
'''


expression = input()
x,y,z = expression.split()
x = int(x)
z=int(z)
if y == "+":
    result = x + z
elif y == "-":
    result = x - z
elif y == "*":
    result = x * z
elif y == "/"and z!=0 :
    result = x / z
print(f"{result:.1f}")
